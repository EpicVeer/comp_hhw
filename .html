        I did not celebrate fathers day because. His birth day was coming in this month . on fathers day I just wished him and he wasn't that happy it's because I gave my mom a card and nothing to him but he didn't knew the plan after it . His birthday was on 28th June so as he was on his duty I bought pastries cakes colas and clothes and ofcource some decorating items I decorated the house real quick and set up all the things I bought. and then he arrived he was really shocked and happy that I setted up all these things and yes we cutted the cake and clebrated his Birthday. He was really happy and gave me some choclates later on . <br>
